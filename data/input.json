        "article": "NEW YORK -- Suicides and drug overdoses pushed up U.S. deaths last year, and drove a continuing decline in how long Americans are expected to live. Overall, there were more than 2.8 million U.S. deaths in 2017, or nearly 70,000 more than the previous year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. It was the most deaths in a single year since the government began counting more than a century ago. The increase partly reflects the nation's growing and aging population. But it's deaths in younger age groups -- particularly middle-aged people -- that have had the largest impact on calculations of life expectancy, experts said. \"These sobering statistics are a wake-up call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director, said in a statement. These countries could soon have the highest life expectancies The suicide death rate last year was the highest it's been in at least 50 years, according to U.S. government records. There were more than 47,000 suicides, up from a little under 45,000 the year before. A general decline For decades, U.S. life expectancy was on the upswing, rising a few months nearly every year. Now it's trending the other way: It fell in 2015, stayed level in 2016, and declined again last year, the CDC said. The nation is in the longest period of a generally declining life expectancy since the late 1910s, when World War I and the worst flu pandemic in modern history combined to kill nearly 1 million Americans. Life expectancy in 1918 was 39. Why American women are dying younger Aside from that, \"we've never really seen anything like this,\" said Robert Anderson, who oversees CDC death statistics. In the nation's 10 leading causes of death, only the cancer death rate fell in 2017. Meanwhile, there were increases in seven others - suicide, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, flu/pneumonia, chronic lower respiratory diseases and unintentional injuries. An underlying factor is that the death rate for heart disease -- the nation's No. 1 killer -- has stopped falling. In years past, declines in heart disease deaths were enough to offset increases in some other kinds of death, but no longer, Anderson said. (The CDC's numbers do sometimes change. This week, CDC officials said they had revised their life expectancy estimate for 2016 after some additional data came in.) What's driving it? CDC officials did not speculate about what's behind declining life expectancy, but Dr. William Dietz, a disease prevention expert at George Washington University, sees a sense of hopelessness. Financial struggles, a widening income gap and divisive politics are all casting a pall over many Americans, he suggested. \"I really do believe that people are increasingly hopeless, and that that leads to drug use, it leads potentially to suicide,\" he said. Drug overdose deaths also continued to climb, surpassing 70,000 last year, in the midst of the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. The death rate rose 10 percent from the previous year, smaller than the 21 percent jump seen between 2016 and 2017. That's not quite cause for celebration, said Dr. John Rowe, a professor of health policy and aging at Columbia University. \"Maybe it's starting to slow down, but it hasn't turned around yet,\" Rowe said. \"I think it will take several years.\" Accidental drug overdoses account for more than a third of the unintentional injury deaths, and intentional drug overdoses account for about a tenth of the suicides, said Dr. Holly Hedegaard, a CDC injury researcher. Other findings The CDC figures are based mainly on a review of 2017 death certificates. The life expectancy figure is based on current death trends and other factors. The agency also said: A baby born last year in the U.S. is expected to live about 78 years and 7 months, on average. An American born in 2015 or 2016 was expected to live about a month longer, and one born in 2014 about two months longer than that. The suicide rate was 14 deaths per 100,000 people. That's the highest since at least 1975. The percentage of suicides due to drug overdose has been inching downward. Deaths from flu and pneumonia rose by about 6 percent. The 2017-2018 flu season was one of the worst in more than a decade, and some of the deaths from early in that season appeared in the new death dates. West Virginia was once again the state with the highest rate of drug overdose deaths. The CDC did not release state rates for suicides. Death rates for heroin, methadone and prescription opioid painkillers were flat. But deaths from the powerful painkiller fentanyl and its close opioid cousins continued to soar in 2017. The CDC did not discuss 2017 gun deaths in the reports released Thursday. But earlier CDC reports noted increase rates of suicide by gun and by suffocation or hanging."

        "article": "President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty Thursday to lying to Congress about a Trump real estate project in Russia, and the extent of the president's involvement in and knowledge of that deal. Cohen's plea in federal court in Manhattan, his second in four months, came as part of a new deal with special counsel Robert Mueller. Prosecutors said Cohen lied in order to minimize links between Trump and his Moscow building project, and to give the false impression that the project had died before the Iowa caucuses in February 2016, the first contest on the path toward a presidential nomination. On the White House's South Lawn after Cohen's court appearance, the president accused his former fixer of lying about his most recent admissions in order to \"get a reduced sentence.\" \"He's a weak person and not a very smart person,\" Trump said. Trump's lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, attacked Cohen's credibility: \"Michael Cohen is a liar.\" Cohen, 52, did not previously have a formal cooperation agreement with Mueller, but it is known that he has been speaking for the past several months to the special counsel's office and other law enforcement entities. Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible coordination between Trump campaign-related figures and the Kremlin, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump. Cohen told a judge Thursday that he lied in 2017 to the Senate Intelligence Committee about a proposed Trump Tower development in Moscow in order to be consistent with Trump's political messages and out of loyalty to the president. Cohen's violation carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and three years of supervised release, according to his plea agreement. Read Cohen's plea agreement here Giuliani said in a statement that \"It's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress\": \"Michael Cohen is a liar. It's no surprise that Cohen lied to Congress,\" Giuliani said. \"He's a proven liar who is doing everything he can to get out of a long-term prison sentence for serious crimes of bank and tax fraud that had nothing to do with the Trump Organization. It is important to understand that documents that the Special Counsel's Office is using to show that Cohen lied to Congress were voluntarily disclosed by the Trump Organization because there was nothing to hide. It is hardly coincidental that the Special Counsel once again files a charge just as the President is leaving for a meeting with world leaders at the G20 Summit in Argentina. The Special Counsel did the very same thing as the President was leaving for a world summit in Helsinki. With regard to the hotel proposal in Moscow, the President has been completely open and transparent.\" A court document laying out the special counsel's allegations refer to Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, through the respective pseudonyms \"Individual 1\" and the \"Company.\" The special counsel in a court document said Cohen \"knowingly and deliberately\" lied when he told the Senate committee that the Moscow proposal \"ended in January 2016 and was not discussed extensively with others\" in the Trump Organization. In fact, Cohen discussed the Moscow project with another individual as late as about June 2016, and briefed Trump on it more times than he had claimed to the Senate committee, the special counsel wrote. Mueller's team adds that Cohen \"briefed family members of [Trump] within the Company about the project.\" Cohen had made the false claim in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee in September 2017. \"I assume we will discuss the rejected proposal to build a Trump property in Moscow that was terminated in January of 2016; which occurred before the Iowa caucus and months before the very first primary,\" Cohen said in that letter. \"This was solely a real estate deal and nothing more. I was doing my job. I would ask that the two-page statement about the Moscow proposal that I sent to the Committee in August be incorporated into and attached to this transcript.\" Read Cohen's criminal information here The special counsel also writes that Cohen lied when he told lawmakers that he didn't recall hearing a response about the project from Russia. Cohen's appearance in court was a surprise. He is due to be sentenced Dec. 12 on his prior guilty plea of eight criminal counts related to tax fraud, excessive campaign contributions and making false statements to a financial institution. Those charges came in a separate federal case not directly lodged by the special counsel. In that hearing in August, Cohen said he paid two women at the request of a political candidate later confirmed to be Trump \"for the principal purpose of influencing the election.\" The women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, claimed they had had affairs with Trump. The White House denies the allegations. At the courthouse on Thursday, Cohen pleaded to a single count of making false statements to Congress. Cohen attorney Lanny Davis declined CNBC's requests for comment. The White House had no immediate comment when asked about Cohen's guilty plea. Trump was preparing to travel to Buenos Aires for the G-20 summit as Cohen pleaded guilty. In a tweet shortly after his comments outside the White House on Thursday, Trump announced that he had canceled his planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Argentina summit. Trump said his decision was based on Russia's seizure of Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait of the Black Sea. Trump tweet Putin meeting Neither Cohen nor his criminal defense lawyer Guy Petrillo had any comment for a horde of reporters confronting them as they exited the lower Manhattan courthouse about 50 minutes after the plea hearing began. After Trump won the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the then-president elect denied having anything to do with Russia. Trump tweet no deals The Washington Post reported in August 2017 that Cohen had emailed Putin's personal secretary during the 2016 presidential campaign to request assistance in moving along a stalled Trump Tower development project in Moscow. The development in Cohen's legal saga came shortly after Trump sent multiple tweets raging against the Russia investigation. Trump tweet 1 Trump tweet 2 Trump tweet 3"

        "article": "A New Jersey college gave its students the chance to pick which new restaurant they wanted on campus -- so long as it wasn't Chick-fil-A. After students at Rider University voted for the fast casual restaurant as their top choice in the spring, the private college sent another survey this fall and excluded the fast casual restaurant \"based on the company's record widely perceived to be in opposition to the LGBTQ+ community,\" according to the university. \"Ultimately, we decided to lean in the direction of creating a welcoming environment where differences can be appreciated and where each individual can expect to experience dignity and respect,\" administrators wrote in a letter explaining the decision. \"In many ways, this issue is one that goes beyond our decision and touches on a complex conversation taking place throughout the country.\" The decision quickly sparked backlash, with one student telling the website Campus Reform, \"they sell chicken, so as far as I am concerned that should be the focus.\" Chick-fil-A's corporate values have stirred controversy since 2012, when its president spoke against same-sex marriage and news reports revealed the company donated to organizations opposed to same-sex marriage. That prompted boycotts and kiss-ins from LGTBQ advocates and a rival \"Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day\" organized by conservative politician Mike Huckabee. Rider's decision required a difficult assessment of competing interests, the university said. \"The choices in this situation, like in so many others, were imperfect,\" administrators wrote. \"They challenged us to reflect on our values and consider what kind of community we want to provide for those who live and learn at Rider University. The university has asked its Center for Diversity and Inclusion to organize a campus forum so that the voices of students, faculty, staff and others can continue to be heard. \"We fully acknowledge an organization's right to hold these beliefs, just as we acknowledge the right for individuals in our community and elsewhere to also personally hold the same beliefs,\" campus officials wrote.

        "article": "Criminal charges have been filed against a luxury art and jewelry business in La Jolla that was discovered to be in possession of more than $1 million dollars worth of illegal elephant and rhinoceros ivory, the San Diego City Attorney's office said Wednesday. Carlton Gallery in La Jolla's popular Prospect Street shopping area was discovered to be in possession of more than 300 pieces of ivory and relics made with the illegal product after an investigation that began in May 2017, City Attorney Mara Elliott said at a press conference. The store's salesperson, Sheldon Miles Kupersmith, and the store's owner, Victor Hyman Cohen were named in a criminal complaint filed on Tuesday. The investigation was launched after wildlife officers with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife spotted two art pieces in the store's display windows that appeared to contain ivory. More potentially illegal items were spotted on various trips back to the store and on May 1, 2018, a sting operation uncovered Kupersmith selling ivory products, according to the city attorney's office. That same day, wildlife officers descended on Carlton Gallery with a search warrant. Their sweep confiscated 146 items with ivory from the gallery. Nearly 200 more pieces were discovered in a warehouse nearby, the complaint said. Some of the pieces containing ivory included art sculptures, rings, boxes and ivory pieces themselves. A law banning the sale of nearly all ivory in the state of California took effect on July 1, 2016. Illegal ivory comes from the tooth or tusk from a species of elephant, hippopotamus or walrus and has led to animal trafficking and poaching, according to wildlife animal experts with San Diego Zoo Global. Under Fish and Game Code, there are two exceptions to selling ivory. The ivory must be less than 20 percent by volume in a musical instrument that was manufactured no later than 1975. The second exception is the ivory must be less than five percent in a bona fide antique with historical documentation proving the antique is more than 100 years old. Law enforcement said the ivory pieces in the Carlton Gallery were not part of musical instruments and had ivory more than five percent volume of the product. According to officials with Fish and Wildlife, many times when items such as ivory are confiscated, they go to a warehouse in Denver, Colorado where they are placed permanently. "

        "article": "The Federal Trade Commission today agreed to investigate video game loot boxes, following an official request by Senator Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). In a Congressional oversight committee hearing earlier today, FTC chairman Joe Simons affirmed Sen. Hassan’s request that loot boxes be investigated. The exchange took place in a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing that was mainly focused on data privacy issues, but which ranged into other territories. \"Loot boxes are now endemic in the video game industry and are present in everything from casual smart phone games to the newest, high budget releases,\" said Hassan, adding that loot boxes will \"represent a $50 billion industry by the year 2022,\" likely referring to a report earlier this year from Juniper Research. Games publishers often include loot boxes in their games, which offer in-game boosts and prizes, sometimes at a cost. The practice has flourished in recent years, particularly following enormous success in games like the FIFA series, but it has also been met with consumer resistance in the past year. In 2017, Electronic Arts retooled Star Wars Battlefront 2 following accusations that the game was designed around extracting cash from players through loot crates. Hassan warned that children are particularly susceptible to loot boxes, and that they represent a \"close link\" to gambling. She pointed to moves in other countries, including Japan, the Netherlands and Belgium, to bring in legislation to control the use of video game loot boxes. Last year, Reps. Chris Lee and Sean Quinlan held a news conference in Hawaii that assailed loot crates for preying on children. Earlier this year, Senator Hassan wrote to the Entertainment Software Rating Board to ask how games with loot boxes are rated. The ESRB later added an \"in-game purchases\" label to games that include loot crates. \"It’s time for the FTC to investigate these mechanisms to ensure that children are being adequately protected,\" said Hassan. \"And to educate parents about potential addiction and other negative impacts of these games. She asked Simons if the FTC will investigate further and \"report back.\" Simons offered a simple \"yes\". Polygon has requested comment from the Entertainment Software Association, which represents the government-level interests of games publishers. Update: The ESA sent us the following statement: \"Loot boxes are one way that players can enhance the experience that video games offer. Contrary to assertions, loot boxes are not gambling. They have no real-world value, players always receive something that enhances their experience, and they are entirely optional to purchase. They can enhance the experience for those who choose to use them, but have no impact on those who do not.\""

        "article": "Four 15-year-old Maryland high school football players charged as adults with rape for sexually assaulting four teammates with a broom during a hazing incident have been released on bond. The Damascus High School athletes, whom NBC News is not identifying, were each charged with one count of first-degree rape, three counts of attempted rape and one count of conspiracy to commit rape, Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy said. Each of the students was released Tuesday on $20,000 bond, according to court records. They are not allowed on the premises of Damascus High School, and they are not allowed to contact one another, McCarthy said. A fifth teammate is accused of participating in at least one of the attacks and being charged as a juvenile but is also identified as one of four victims, charging documents show. One of the alleged victims told police that the suspects held him down, pulled his pants down and poked his buttocks with a broomstick before \"the broomstick was inserted into his anus a few inches,\" prosecutors said. Two of the victims said they were violently attacked, but were able to fight off the assailants before they \"got the broom,\" prosecutors said. Another victim said a broomstick, which he described as a wooden handle with a \"cut on the tip of it\" said he was \"stabbed\" on the buttocks with the broomstick. When that victim tried to fight the attack, the suspects told him it was \"tradition,\" he told police. When interviewed by investigators, one of the suspects said the broom \"started from generations ago,\" according to prosecutors, who said freshmen were the ones targeted.Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy said citing tradition is not a defense. “I’m offended by the term hazing. It’s not hazing, these are crimes, and I would caution anyone to refer to this as hazing. These boys were victims of criminal acts,” McCarthy said. \"They were not victims of hazing, they were victims of first-degree rapes.” The alleged rapes and attempted rapes happened on Oct. 31, according to the court documents. Damascus High School's principal reported the possible assaults to police on Nov. 1. Montgomery County Public School District Superintendent Jack Smith said in a statement that the district is cooperating with police and providing support for Damascus High School students. \"Our thoughts are with the students, staff and all who have been affected,\" Smith said."

        "article": "Reggae has been added to a list of international cultural treasures which the United Nations has deemed worthy of protecting and promoting. The music, which grew out of Jamaica in the 1960s thanks to artists like Toots and the Maytals, Peter Tosh and Bob Marley, was added to the collection due to its \"intangible cultural heritage\". Reggae is \"cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual,\" said Unesco. It has \"penetrated all corners of the world,\" added a Jamaican spokesperson. Reggae followed on from the ska and rocksteady genres - other early pioneers included Lee Scratch Perry and Prince Buster.Millie Small's 1964 ska cover of My Boy Lollipop also helped introduce reggae's laidback groove to the world. Reggae became popular in the United States but particularly flourished in the UK, which had become home to many Jamaican immigrants since the end of World War Two. The British reggae label Trojan, which celebrates its 50th birthday this year, introduced the world to artists like Desmond Dekker, Jimmy Cliff and Bob and Marcia. \"I am delighted, it's wonderful news,\" BBC 1Xtra veteran presenter Dave Rodigan told World Service radio. \"I've loved this music since I first heard it as a teenager.\" Speaking to 5 live he added: \"I've always said it speaks out for the underprivileged, it speaks out against social injustice. Reggae music is the original rebels' music immortalised by Bob Marley at the Wailers.\"Jamaica had applied for reggae's inclusion on the list this year at a meeting of the UN agency on the island of Mauritius. The protected list began in 2008 and grew out of the UN's convention for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage in 2003. Its aims are to ensure respect for communities, groups and individuals involved in the listed activity, to raise awareness and encourage appreciation of those activities nationally and internationally. \"Reggae is uniquely Jamaican,\" said Olivia Grange, Jamaica's culture minister. \"It is a music that we have created that has penetrated all corners of the world.\" Announcing the decision, Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) said the music's \"contribution to international discourse on issues of injustice, resistance, love and humanity underscores the dynamics of the element as being at once cerebral, socio-political, sensual and spiritual\". It added: \"The basic social functions of the music - as a vehicle for social commentary, a cathartic practice, and a means of praising God - have not changed, and the music continues to act as a voice for all.\" Other cultural traditions which made the list included a Spanish riding school in Vienna, a Mongolian camel-coaxing ritual and Egyptian puppetry."

        "article": "A Maryland woman who was mauled by a pit bull while she was taking her trash out of her apartment complex says she fought the dog, biting it so it would let go of her. \"I had the animal face to face, and I saw the big eyes,\" said Rosa Quexel, holding back tears. \"I didn’t know if I was going to survive that moment.\" According to the victim, she was walking outside of her apartment building in the 8100 block of Tahona Drive in Langley Park when she noticed two pit bulls were attacking someone near her. Then one of them pounced on her. She raised her left arm and put it between them to try to hold the animal back. That’s when it began biting her. \"The first thing I thought, ‘I will bite it, too,’ because if I don’t do it, it won’t let go of me,\" Quexel said. \"That’s when I bit the dog with all my strength, and it let go.\" She said she fainted after the attack and doesn’t know what happened to the animals. Quexel said she was then taken to the University of Maryland Capital Region Health to get treated for the arm injuries she sustained. \"If I hadn’t put my arm [between us], it could have bitten my face or my neck,\" she said. \"I don’t know what would have happened.\" Prince George’s County police said they haven’t been able to locate the dogs or the owner. Pit bulls are banned in Prince George's County, as well as in many apartment buildings and homeowners associations across the D.C. area. Residents of the county who violate the ordinance may receive a $1,000 fine or a sentence to up to 6 months in jail. Entire rescue organizations in the region are devoted to finding homes for pit bulls. \"People keep having those animals, that are often killers,\" Quexel said. \"I don’t want this to go unpunished.\" \"I want justice,\" she added. \"I want those animals to be caught and that the owner is contacted because I have medical bills that I can’t afford.\" Similar incidents have happened recently across the region. A D.C. woman died after she was attacked by the family’s pit bull in her own home, and in September, a Maryland woman apparently was mauled to death by a recently adopted dog, also a pit bull."

        "article": "Samsung isn’t just competing with Chinese companies in the smartphone market. Chinese component manufacturers are also eyeing the Korean giant’s lead in this market. Samsung has been able to retain its dominance largely due to its greater technological prowess and scalability. The protection of Samsung’s intellectual property is, therefore, key to its very survival. Its lead in the market is no laughing matter. Samsung Display has a near monopoly in the small to mid-sized OLED segment as it supplies over 95 percent of all panels. It contributes a significant chunk of the conglomerate’s revenues. Even Chinese smartphone manufacturers have been using Samsung’s OLED panels in their flagship smartphones. That’s because the OLED technology of Chinese panel manufacturers still has a lot of catching up to do with Samsung’s technology. Vendor’s employees were leaking Samsung’s OLED secrets to China Prosecutors in South Korea have indicted 11 people for leaking Samsung’s OLED technology to China. They’re the employees of a vendor that apparently produced automated equipment used for manufacturing OLED panels. They have been indicted on charges of leaking Samsung Display’s 3D Lamination technology for curved OLED panels. Three of the 11 people indicted have been arrested and now await trial. The list includes the company’s CEO as well. They had allegedly set up a shell company to which they sent the information received from working with Samsung about equipment and drawings of the display panels. The trade secrets were then sold to an undisclosed Chinese buyer for approximately $14 million. Secondary names, phones, and personal email addresses were used to avoid being caught even as they violated a non-disclosure agreement signed with Samsung. Samsung will certainly not be letting this go. The technology that was leaked reportedly took Samsung Display six years and millions of dollars to develop. The company had a team of 38 engineers working on it. Samsung had the technology designated as a national core technology protected by South Korea’s industrial technology protection laws. Samsung Display has said in a statement that it is \"shocked at the results of the investigation by prosecutors, at a time when competitors are intensifying their technological rivalry.\" It will be keeping a close eye on the trial."

        "article": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA (FOX 11) - Detectives found Nazi memorabilia and an \"arsenal\" of more than fifty firearms, including assault rifles and snipers, in the home of a Huntington Beach man who was arrested by police on Tuesday. Laguna Beach Police took 51-year-old Mitchell Todd into custody after serving a search warrant at the 15000 block of Cambay Lane Tuesday morning. Todd is the owner of an Orange County dove releasing business. Police told FOX 11 Todd is being assessed by psychological staff at a local hospital. He will then be booked into the county jail in Santa Ana, with more charges expected to come down. LBPD told FOX 11 they had been investigating Todd since mid November after he allegedly began making physical threats to a man he had been having a business dispute with. The man had hired Todd to release doves at his son’s funeral, and there was a dispute about payment. \"The suspect had made a verbal threat stating words to the effect of maybe you need to go be with your son,\" said Sgt. Jim Cota of Laguna Beach PD. \"You could tell the voicemails and text messages became more and more threatening and then the tip of the iceberg was hearing the releasing of a handgun slide, so at that point we knew we were dealing with somebody whose got the potential of extreme violence.\" Detectives obtained a search warrant and arrested Todd on Tuesday. A search of his home would reveal a stockpile of weapons and ammo, including assault rifles and snipers. \"Definitely an arsenal, we’re trying to figure out why one person would have in excess of 50 guns, at least in my career it’s stands up there with the top 5 in terms of firepower,\" Sgt. Cota said. \"This is definitely an amount of weaponry that is not for personal use.\" Sgt. Cota told FOX 11 detectives also found a confederate flag and Nazi memorabilia in Todd’s home. \"We also found some memorabilia that was a reference to the Third Reich and Nazi paraphernalia that were gonna look into just to see if there’s any ties to any hate groups or anything like that,\" he said. Neighbors told FOX 11 off camera that Todd is known as the \"crazy guy\" in the neighborhood, and that Nazi memorabilia had been seen in his windows before. Sgt. Cota told FOX 11 that only 12 of the recovered weapons are registered to Todd, and the DOJ and ATF will likely have to be brought in to investigate. He believes his detectives may have prevented something terrible from happening. \"I couldn’t be more proud of the detectives and the work that they did tonight, my gut feeling tells me we did potentially stop something that could’ve been, I can’t even put into words what could’ve been forthcoming,\" he said. Todd has been booked on charges of criminal threats, though weapons charges are expected to be added on. He remains in Laguna Beach police custody Tuesday night, and will be brought to the Santa Ana jail on Wednesday. Statement from ATF Los Angeles: \"ATF is going to assist Laguna PD with their investigation. ATF will be looking at the firearms inventory, performing traces on the firearms and determining whether all federal firearms regulations were followed by the individual.\" Investigators will be looking into any possible connections with known hate groups."

        "article": "Inside the New Brunswick Heart Centre, workers toil away in the surgery department and special examination rooms, assigned to cut costly bottlenecks so more patients can be seen more quickly. These workers are not hospital employees, however. They’re from a branch of Medtronic, a medical device giant that makes life-changing products from insulin pumps to pacemakers. Medtronic doesn’t just sell medical devices. The company’s burgeoning Integrated Health Solutions (IHS) business has consulted and partnered with more than 100 hospitals around the world, often with units that specialize in health conditions for which Medtronic makes devices. Under the deals, Medtronic does everything from managing cardiac catheterization labs to overseeing inventory to consulting services. This is a new frontier of public healthcare, where cash-strapped hospitals open their operations to a private company — a multinational that has paid the U.S. government millions to settle claims that it defrauded federal health programs and gave kickbacks to doctors to implant its devices. An investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its 58 media partners, including the Star/CBC/Radio-Canada, has found some of these international partnerships include incentives for the hospitals, such as staff donated by Medtronic. In return, the company would benefit from increased sales a hospital generated as a result of more efficient management. Neither Medtronic nor Horizon Health Network agreed to interviews about the partnership involving the New Brunswick Heart Centre. In statements, Medtronic said it has an unwavering commitment to ethical business practices, and its Integrated Health Solutions branch operates behind a firewall that separates it from the company’s device-selling operations. \"We believe that integrated healthcare is the future of healthcare delivery and that IHS and value-based initiatives will be instrumental in reducing healthcare costs and improving quality of care,\" a Medtronic spokesman said. \"This leads to better patient outcomes at lower costs.\" The motive behind the partnerships, according to a former U.S. Medtronic director who oversaw contracts the company had with hospitals, is simple: To entrench Medtronic in the inner-workings of the hospital. \"We’ll help you be better and more efficient. But we need to get more business out of it,\" the former director told the Star. He asked not to be named because he still interacts with the medical device industry in his new job. \"Medtronic wants to get you to the point where you can’t live without them.\" By tying perks like free staff or better pricing to hospital revenue growth, these partnerships \"will turn these healthcare systems into cash cows rather than service professions,\" said Dr. Nortin Hadler, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"I can envision a marketing slogan for my hospital along the lines of ‘What’s good for Medtronic is good for the patient.’ \" Read More: Biocell breast implants at centre of ‘biggest controversy in plastic surgery’ Faulty and unproven medical devices implanted in Canadian patients despite known risks Medtronic began in a Minneapolis garage in 1949, where Earl Bakken, an electrical engineer, fixed lab equipment with his brother-in-law. In the late 1950s, Bakken created the first wearable, battery-powered pacemaker, an innovation that would help save millions of lives and set the small company on its way to become a global behemoth. In a July speech to the Manitoba Chambers of Commerce, Medtronic’s CEO Omar Ishrak boasted that the company has excelled in not only developing innovative technologies but \"inventing new markets,\" through which Medtronic helps more than 70 million patients a year, or two people every second. In its meteoric ascension, the company has repeatedly landed in court. Medtronic has agreed to pay at least $115 million to the U.S. government over the last decade to settle claims that it broke the law. In paying the settlements, Medtronic denied any wrongdoing. The settlements all stemmed from lawsuits filed by whistleblowers, mostly former company insiders. Under U.S. law, the government can pursue lawsuits filed by whistleblowers against companies that allegedly defrauded the government. The whistleblowers receive a portion of the proceeds if the case is successful. Medtronic has also been ensnared in thousands of lawsuits from patients around the world — and at least one Toronto hospital — seeking money for alleged damages caused by Medtronic devices. Chief among those devices are the Sprint Fidelis leads, insulated wires connecting implanted defibrillators to patients’ hearts that were prone to fracture, causing unnecessary shocks. The first-ever Sprint Fidelis lead was implanted inside a London, Ont., operating room in early 2004. By late 2007, more than 268,000 Sprint Fidelis leads were implanted worldwide, including into chests of some 5,900 Canadians. One of them was Sherry Robinson of Sechelt, a coastal community northwest of Vancouver. Robinson had suffered from \"passouts\" since she was a kid. But by 2005, they were getting worse. It was taking longer to regain consciousness. \"I knew I was getting to the point where I wasn’t going to survive these,\" she said in an interview. Robinson, then 32, was given an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a Sprint Fidelis lead after she suffered cardiac arrest. It was a \"life saver.\" She finally felt comfortable doing something as simple as vacuuming while she was home alone, no longer afraid she would over-exert and pass out. One night in January 2007, just before going to sleep, a jolt thrust her forward in bed. \"I saw this white light through my eyes. It hurt like hell. I thought, ‘I’ve been hit by lightning,’ \" she said. \"It took me a couple of seconds to catch my breath and realize: ‘Oh my God, that’s my defibrillator.’ \" She was rushed to hospital and, after tests showed her heart was fine, she was sent home. The following two nights, she again received shocks. Then, while hooked up to a monitor at the hospital, her defibrillator rattled off \"a firing storm\" — six consecutive shocks. An air ambulance flew her to a Vancouver hospital, where she suffered another firing storm. By the time her ICD was deactivated, she had received 18 shocks. Doctors determined the lead had fractured, causing it to shoot false signals to the defibrillator. On Jan. 24, 2007, she had the lead removed and replaced with a new one. Again, it was a Sprint Fidelis. Around that time, a U.S. doctor was flagging problems with the thin wires and approached Medtronic. The company sent a notice to surgeons, attributing the fractures to improper handling by physicians. By October 2007, Medtronic’s message changed. Stop implanting the leads, the company warned, as the wires had a risk of fracturing that could cause an implanted defibrillator to fire inappropriate shocks or stop working completely. Medtronic halted sales of the leads across the world. The fractured leads may have been a contributing factor in 13 deaths, the company later announced. Robinson remembers sitting in a room with other patients at a Vancouver hospital as doctors explained the company’s safety warning. \"I was very mad and upset,\" she said. \"Long before (Medtronic) told us, long before they informed the doctors, they had to know that things were wrong with these leads.\" Medtronic has said the leads had met rigorous \"safety, effectiveness and quality standards\" before being approved in Canada, and the company closely monitored how the products performed in patients. \"Safety is our first priority, and we categorically reject any suggestion that Medtronic puts ‘innovation and profits’ over patient safety,\" the company said in a statement. For four more years, Robinson lived in fear her second Sprint Fidelis lead would cause her defibrillator to misfire again. In 2011, she underwent a risky procedure to have the lead removed. Robinson is the lead plaintiff in an ongoing Canadian class-action lawsuit against Medtronic over the leads. And it’s not just patients suing. In a separate lawsuit, Toronto’s Health Network demanded $750,000 from Medtronic for \"the recovery of costs, expenses and damages … incurred as a result of purchase and implantation of Sprint Fidelis leads.\" The two sides settled, a hospital spokesperson said, adding that the terms are confidential. Current healthcare systems are wasteful, unsustainable and in need of fixing, Medtronic has said time and again. Think of the healthcare system itself as a sick patient, Neil Fraser, president of Medtronic Canada, said on the company’s website about the company’s partnerships with hospitals. \"What we’re trying to do is address an illness that can be helped through technology, innovation and collaboration.\" A partnership would be a \"win-win,\" the company described in a 2014 presentation to investors. A hospital would save by reducing the cost of providing care, and Medtronic would make tens of millions of dollars in \"incremental device and service sales.\" It was part of how, as enthusiastic analysts at PriceWaterhouseCoopers put it, Medtronic would \"own the disease.\" The company would earn money \"not for selling pacemakers but for preserving heartbeats.\" By January 2014, Medtronic was ready to push its blossoming health solutions business into Canada. The company had hand-picked the Brampton Civic Hospital’s Diabetes Education Centre as a pilot project to prove its \"optimization\" services would work here. In Peel, one in 10 adults has diabetes, a number that could rise to one in six by 2025, according to Medtronic. For 12 months, Medtronic reps hosted workshops and trained clinic staff to identify and correct bottlenecks and gaps in the system. The goal, the company said, was to cut down on \"administrative burden\" to give the healthcare providers \"more time to spend with their patients.\" Medtronic did it all for free. In the end, the number of new patients visiting the clinic increased by 33 per cent. More patients are good for business, the former Medtronic director said. \"Finding these efficiencies — cutting down on re-admissions, seeing more patients, it helps a hospital’s bottom line. It all goes to Medtronic’s bottom line, too, because it helps them sell more products,\" he said. In February 2014, one month after putting together the deal with the Brampton hospital, Medtronic partnered with a newly formed neuroscience department at the University of Alberta hospital. The contract outlined how Medtronic would review the program’s \"patient experience map\" from referral to surgeries to out-patient care. The hospital signed a five-month contract and renewed it twice. As in Brampton, Medtronic offered its services for free. Its reward, the contract notes, would include expanding Medtronic’s \"network within the field of neurosciences.\" The former U.S. Medtronic director said the company is deliberate in what hospitals it approaches for prospective partnerships. \"These things don’t necessarily get pitched to customers who don’t have Medtronic business,\" he said. \"You only bring it up to a customer when it’s going to benefit you.\" He said the company sometimes laces \"incentives\" into the agreement, such as free training or consulting services, \"some on paper, some not.\" In the United Kingdom, Medtronic secured contracts to manage two healthcare centres’ catheterization labs, which produce diagnostic images of patients’ hearts and arteries. A 2013 Financial Times article quoted a Medtronic official saying the agreement would include a negotiated minimum quota of purchases of Medtronic equipment. Doctors would ultimately choose what medical devices to use on patients, the official said. The agreement saved Imperial College in London nearly $2.6 million each year, according to a presentation by the health centre’s head of cardiology. Spokeswomen from both the Brampton and Alberta hospitals say there were no procurement quotas built into their agreements with Medtronic. \"All of (Alberta Health Services’) procurement decisions as it relates to Medtronic were, and are, made independent of this arrangement,\" a spokeswoman said. The alleged incentives Medtronic’s offers to drive sales of its devices have been the subject of lawsuits in the U.S. The company paid the U.S. government $23.5 million in 2011 to settle claims that Medtronic gave kickbacks to induce doctors to implant its pacemakers and defibrillators. Medtronic denies the allegations and said the settlement was not an admission of liability. Medtronic solicited physicians to run studies and device registries, paying them as much as $2,000 per enrolled patient, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged. But the payments for the research were a guise to sway physicians away from using competitors’ products or to reward doctors for continuing to use Medtronic devices, the government alleged. In one of the whistleblower complaints that led to the settlement, a former Medtronic employee alleged the kickbacks were part of the company’s broader \"effort to corner the market on cardiac rhythm devices,\" and many of the studies were \"bogus\" and had \"no utility to the medical field whatsoever.\" One of those alleged kickback schemes named in the 2011 settlement was the TRENDS study, whose lead investigators included Canadian doctor D. George Wyse, who is internationally recognized for his work in heart rhythm management. In an interview, Wyse said he never received any kickbacks and wasn’t aware of the allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice. The only payments he would have received from Medtronic would have been honoraria for participating in the study’s advisory committee or for presenting the research findings, Wyse said, which are common for professionals conducting industry-funded research. The focus of the study was novel and important, Wyse said. Researchers used heart monitoring capabilities in already-implanted Medtronic ICDs to see the relationship between atrial fibrillation — an abnormal heartbeat that can lead to blood clots — and the risk of stroke. Its findings, published in 2009, have been cited at least 359 times, and Wyse said the topic continues to be pursued by researchers. \"I definitely would say TRENDS was not a bogus study by any stretch of the imagination,\" Wyse said. \"I’m pretty sure (kickbacks from industry) happen but I don’t have any personal knowledge of that.\" In a statement, Medtronic said it has \"long been a leader in promoting ethical practices in collaboration between industry and the medical community.\" \"We stand behind the integrity of our corporate governance systems and our unwavering commitment to ethical business practices.\" In an ongoing U.S. whistleblower lawsuit, former Medtronic sales manager Adam Witkin alleged the company would pay \"certified pump trainers\" upwards of $425 to teach a new patient how to use the company’s insulin pumps, what he called \"a kickback disguised as a training payment.\" Medtronic told the court these payments were not illegal and that the company has an ethical obligation to provide the training and education. Christine Landry, a registered nurse from Cornwall, began giving training sessions on behalf of Medtronic in 2009, a few months after getting one of the company’s insulin pumps for her own use. About the size of a deck of cards, the pump is worn outside the body and delivers the insulin through a small tube that is inserted into a layer of fat under the skin. It’s up to the pump user to monitor her glucose level and manage the amount of insulin delivered around mealtimes. Landry trained pump users and led diabetic support groups until 2012. That year, in July, Landry called Medtronic’s 24-hour helpline. Her pump was malfunctioning. The company calltaker said Medtronic would send a new pump and advised her to use a back-up plan to administer her insulin. When a Medtronic rep called back a short time later to confirm her address, Landry was disoriented. The 48-year-old could barely remember her birth date. The next morning, her adult son found her unconscious in her bed. She needed constant care for six years until she died in September 2018. In court documents responding to a lawsuit by the Landry family alleging its pump was defective, Medtronic said it had tested the pump and found no problems. Landry was \"fully aware\" of the risks associated with the pump, Medtronic alleged, and any damages suffered by her or her family were caused by her own negligence. But listening to his mother’s last phone call — hearing her struggle with basic details — Philippe Landry questions why the Medtronic rep didn’t contact 911 or do more to make sure she was okay. \"You can clearly tell that she wasn’t okay and he didn’t ask anything about that,\" the son said. In 2016, Medtronic signed a five-year partnership with the New Brunswick Heart Centre. No stone would be unturned in the quest for efficiencies at the heart centre, the main provider of adult cardiac care for New Brunswick and the surrounding areas. Medtronic representatives began in the heart surgery department, and then moved to advising the cath lab, which uses diagnostic imaging equipment to detect abnormalities in a patient’s arteries. Within six months, they increased operating room capacity by 14 per cent and reduced the average wait times by nearly half, according to a Medtronic press release. \"Hopefully, this is a model that we can apply to other institutions and other provinces not only in Canada but around the world,\" Medtronic CEO Ishrak said in a company video. But little is known about the partnership beyond the company’s promotional material. A copy of the nine-page contract, released under freedom of information legislation, is marked \"confidential.\" The hospital said it contains Medtronic’s trade secrets. And so, page after page, are big black boxes, blocking out any detail of what the public hospital is getting from the services and what it’s giving Medtronic. — With files from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists Jesse McLean is a Toronto-based investigative reporter.
